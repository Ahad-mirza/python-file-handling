# üìÇ Python File Handling

## üöÄ Overview

File handling in Python allows us to interact with files on our computer, enabling reading, writing, appending, and deleting files. Python makes working with files easy, whether they're text files, binary files, or CSV files.

In this guide, we'll explore different ways to interact with files, handle errors, and discuss which types of files Python can handle.

## üìù Opening a File

To work with a file, use Python's built-in `open()` function. It takes two parameters:
- **filename**: The name of the file.
- **mode**: Specifies how the file should be opened (e.g., reading, writing).

### üìú File Modes:
- **`'r'`**: Read mode (default).
- **`'w'`**: Write mode (overwrites file).
- **`'a'`**: Append mode (adds content to the end).
- **`'b'`**: Binary mode (used for non-text files like images).
- **`'x'`**: Exclusive creation mode (raises error if file exists).

### Example: Opening a File in Read Mode

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

---
## üìñ Reading from a File
Once a file is opened, you can read from it using:

- `read()`: Reads the entire file as a string.
- `readline()`: Reads one line at a time.
- `readlines()`: Returns all lines as a list.
**Example: Reading the Entire File**
```python
Copy code
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

---
## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing to a File

You can write data to a file using the `write()` method. If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, Python will create it.

### Example: Writing to a New File

```python
data = ["Hello", "Welcome to file handling!", "Python makes it easy."]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in data:
        file.write(line + "\n")
```
### In this example:

We define a list of strings `(data)`.
- The file output.txt is opened in write mode `('w')`.
- Each line from the list is written into the file, and a newline character `(\n)` is added to separate the lines.
After running this code, the content will be written to output.txt. If the file doesn't already exist, it will be created automatically.

---

## ‚ûï Appending to a File

To add data to an existing file without overwriting, use append mode (`'a'`).

### Example: Appending Data to a File

```python
new_data = ["New line added", "Another new line"]
with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:
    for line in new_data:
        file.write(line + "\n")
```
In this example:

- We define a list of strings `(new_data)`.
- The file output.txt is opened in append mode `('a')`.
- Each new line is appended to the file without overwriting the existing content.
After running this code, the new lines will be added to the end of the file output.txt, preserving the previous content.

---
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling with Files

When working with files, you may encounter errors like a file not being found or permission issues. We can handle these errors using `try-except` blocks.

### Example: Handling File Not Found and Permission Errors

```python
file_name = "example.txt"

try:
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_name}' was not found.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Error: Permission denied to read the file '{file_name}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
In this example:

- We attempt to open the file example.txt in read mode `('r')`.
- If the file is not found, a `FileNotFoundError` is caught and an error message is printed.
- If there are permission issues, a `PermissionError` is caught.
- A general `Exception` block is used to catch any unexpected errors.
This allows us to handle potential errors gracefully, ensuring the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.

## ‚ùå Closing a File

After using a file, it is important to close it using the `close()` method to free up resources. Alternatively, you can use a **context manager** (`with` statement) to automatically close the file when done.

### üîÑ Using Context Manager (`with` statement)

The `with` statement simplifies file handling by ensuring the file is automatically closed after the operation.

### Example:

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
# File is automatically closed when the block ends

---
## üìÇ Working with File Paths

To work with file paths (checking existence, getting absolute paths), Python provides the `os` and `pathlib` modules.

### Example: Checking if a File Exists

```python
import os

file_name = 'example.txt'
if os.path.exists(file_name):
    print(f"The file '{file_name}' exists.")
else:
    print(f"The file '{file_name}' does not exist.")
```

# üßê Which Files Can Python Handle?

Python can handle various types of files. Below are some of the common file types and how Python works with them:

## 1. **Text Files** (.txt, .csv, .json, etc.)
**How Python Handles It:**
- Open in read ('r'), write ('w'), or append ('a') mode.
- Read or write data as strings.

**Example Files:** `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`

## 2. **Binary Files** (.jpg, .png, .exe, etc.)
**How Python Handles It:**
- Open in binary mode ('rb' or 'wb').
- Read or write data as bytes.

**Example Files:** `.jpg`, `.png`, `.exe`

## 3. **CSV Files**
**How Python Handles It:**
- Use the `csv` module to read/write CSV data.
- The `csv` module allows easy handling of tabular data with proper delimiters.

**Example Files:** `.csv`

## 4. **JSON Files**
**How Python Handles It:**
- Use the `json` module for parsing and writing JSON.
- JSON is commonly used for data interchange and is compatible with many programming languages.

**Example Files:** `.json`

## 5. **Pickle Files**
**How Python Handles It:**
- Python's `pickle` module allows serializing and deserializing Python objects.
- Used for saving Python objects like lists, dictionaries, etc., to a file.

**Example Files:** `.pkl`

## 6. **Excel Files** (.xls, .xlsx)
**How Python Handles It:**
- Use external libraries like `pandas` and `openpyxl` to read/write Excel files.
- These libraries allow you to process Excel spreadsheets and perform data analysis.

**Example Files:** `.xls`, `.xlsx`
